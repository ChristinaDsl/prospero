### Register custom channel

In order for the server to receive updates from a custom channel, the server needs to be subscribed to the channel and associated repositories.

The channel can be hosted either in an internal installation repository, serving a single server or in a shared repository. To configure the server with a custom channel following commands can be used:

*Single server channel*

```
prospero channel add \
  --channel-name customizations \
  --repositories file:/path/to/local/repository \
  --manifest org.wildfly.prospero:customizations
```
A server can use a filesystem repository and auto-generated channel to provide customizations. This command will register the server to recieve updates from a Maven repository in `/path/to/local/repository` folder.

The customized artifacts should be listed in a manifest file deployed to the above repository as `org.wildfly.prospero:customizations:manifest:yaml:<VERSION>`

*Shared channel*

An online repository can be used to distribute the customizations among multiple servers. Each server has to be subscribed to the repository using:

```
prospero channel add \
  --channel-name customizations \
  --repositories http://repository.host/path \
  --manifest=org.wildfly.prospero:customizations
```

NOTE: The repository can be used to host customizations applicable to a different group of servers. In that case each set of customizations would have a separate manifest deployed under unique Maven `groupId:artifactId` coordinates.

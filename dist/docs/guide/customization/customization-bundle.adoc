### Distributing custom artifacts

The customized artifacts can be distributed as bundles. Each bundle is a ZIP archive containing an `artifact-list.yaml` file and a `repository` directory.

```
|-artifact-list.yaml
|-repository
  |- org
    |-custom
      |-artifact-one
        |-1.2.3
          |-artifact-one-1.2.3.jar
      |-artifact-two
        |-2.3.4
          |-artifact-two-2.3.4.jar
```

The `artifact-list.yaml` lists all artifacts included in the bundle using following syntax:
```
artifacts:
  - groupId: "org.custom"
    artifactId: "artifact-one"
    version: "1.2.3"
    packaging: "jar"
    extension: ""
```

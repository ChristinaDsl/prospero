### Promoting custom artifacts

To make the custom artifact available to registered servers, the update artifacts from the customization bundle have to be added to the existing repository.

The updated artifacts are distributed in a `maven-repository` folder inside the customization archive. If the server is subscribed to a local filesystem customization repository, all the artifacts can be simply copied over.

[source, bash]
```
$ ./prospero.sh channel list
# customizations
  manifest: org.wildfly.prospero:customizations
  repositories:
    id: custom-repo-0
    url: file:/home/wildfly/custom/repository # <1>

$ unzip customization-1.0.1.zip # <2>
Archive:  customization-1.0.1.zip
   creating: customization/
   inflating: artifact-list.yaml
   creating: customization/maven-repository/
   [...]

$ cp -r customization/maven-repositry/* /home/wildfly/custom/repository/ #<3>

$ ./prospero.sh updates perform #<4>
```
<1> Location of existing customization repository
<2> Extracting updated repository
<3> Adding updated content to existing repository
<4> Apply updated customizations

If a repository manager like Nexus is used to host the customization repository, the artifacts should be deployed into it.

WARNING: When promoting different versions of the same customization bundle, older versions of the bundle should never be promoted after a newer version is promoted. The customization repository contains `maven-metadata.xml` files associated with the customization's manifest that would be overwritten by such operation.

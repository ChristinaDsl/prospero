### Replicating installation

Sometimes it might be needed to provision a copy of the server, with the same components as the original, in a different environment. To achieve that, Prospero requires following information:

* a list of component versions used to provision the server,
* a list of channels used during provisioning,
* a list of Galleon feature packs used.

This information can be obtained from any provisioned server using `clone export` command:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./prospero.sh clone export --dir wfly-27 --path snapshot.zip
Exporting /tmp/wfly-27 installation details to /tmp/snapshot.zip
Export complete
----

The generated archive contains following files:
[source, bash]
----
Archive:  snapshot.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
    68301  05-26-2023 15:59   manifest.yaml
      476  05-26-2023 15:59   installer-channels.yaml
      606  05-26-2023 15:59   provisioning.xml
---------                     -------
    69383                     3 files
----

The archive can be used to rebuild the server:
[source,bash]
----
$ ./prospero clone recreate --dir cloned --path export.zip
Recreating a server in /tmp/cloned based on /tmp/export.zip

### Feature Packs

Galleon is a provisioning tool used to assemble Wildfly distributions. In order for a piece of software to be provisioned by Galleon it needs to be packaged as a feature-pack.

Feature packs are ZIP archives usually available in Maven repositories. They contain information about installed software's filesystem content, configuration and additional tasks needed to assemble and configure it.

In case of Wildfly server, the feature pack also contains a list of Maven coordinates for all the components included in the server distribution. During provisioning, those coordinates are used to download the components and place them in resulting server.
